**`i3`** is a tiling inventory for Minetest 5.4+ with a modern UI using the latest technologies of the Minetest engine.
It supports everything what [**`craftguide`**](https://github.com/minetest-mods/craftguide) can do, with an inventory on top of that.

This inventory features a **Progressive Mode**.
This mode is a Terraria-like system that shows recipes you can craft from items you ever had in your inventory.
To enable it: `i3_progressive_mode = true` in `minetest.conf`.

For developers, **`i3`** also has a [modding API](https://github.com/minetest-mods/i3/blob/master/API.md).

This mod supports the following mods:
   - [`3d_armor`](https://github.com/minetest-mods/3d_armor)
   - [`skinsdb`](https://github.com/minetest-mods/skinsdb)
   - [`awards`](https://gitlab.com/rubenwardy/awards)
