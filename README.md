#### **`i3`** is the inventory of your wildest dreams.

This inventory offers a slick, modern UI made with the latest technologies of the Minetest engine.
**`i3`** provides a rich [**API**](https://github.com/minetest-mods/i3/blob/master/API.md) for mod developers who want to extend it.

This mod requires **Minetest 5.4+**

#### List of features:
   - Crafting Guide (only in survival mode)
   - Progressive Mode¹
   - Quick Crafting
   - 3D Player Model Preview
   - Inventory Sorting (alphabetical + item stack compression)
   - Item Bookmarks

**¹** *This mode is a Terraria-like system that shows recipes you can craft from items you ever had in your inventory.
To enable it: `i3_progressive_mode = true` in `minetest.conf`.*

#### This mod officially supports the following mods:
   - [**`3d_armor`**](https://content.minetest.net/packages/stu/3d_armor/)

   - Use the default font style with Freetype
   - **DON'T** change the default font size settings
   - **DON'T** change the default GUI scaling setting
